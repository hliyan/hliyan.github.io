    - title: The three principles of Redux (Flux library for React.js)
      url: http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html
      quotes:
        - "State is read only: This ensures that the views or the network callbacks never write directly to the state, and instead express the intent to mutate. Because all mutations are centralized and happen one by one in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for. Actions are just plain objects, so they can be logged, serialized, stored, and later replayed for debugging or testing purposes."
    - title: Market Maturity
      url: http://www.uie.com/articles/market_maturity/
      quotes: 
        - "Say your company is the first one to introduce a product with a radically new concept, and people love it. In the Raw Iron stage, users are excited about the product’s most basic capabilities, and they’ll pay top dollar for them."
        - "During the Raw Iron stage, the development team is focused primarily on solving technical and delivery issues so they can get the product out the door to its eager new market."
        - "In the Checklist Battles stage, one or more competitors have entered the arena, each adding their own bells and whistles to the basic product. In this stage, functionality becomes the key differentiator."
        - "As a genre enters the Productivity Wars stage, all the vendors offer pretty much the same functionality. They consider their own productivity when deciding what to buy."

      quotes:

          "Once upon a time, it was taken for granted that the wealthier classes enjoyed a life of leisure on the backs of the proletariat. Today it is people in skilled trades who can most find reasonable hours coupled with good pay; the American professional is among those subject to humiliation and driven like a beast of burden."
    - title: The Theoretical Minimum
      url: http://theoreticalminimum.com/
      quotes:
        - |
          "A number of years ago I became aware of the large number of physics enthusiasts 
          out there who have no venue to learn modern physics and cosmology.  
          Fat advanced textbooks are not suitable to people who have no teacher to ask questions of, 
          and the popular literature does not go deeply enough to satisfy these curious people.  
          So I started a series of courses on modern physics at Stanford University where I am a professor of physics.  
          The courses are specifically aimed at people who know, or once knew, 
          a bit of algebra and calculus, but are more or less beginners."
    - title: "JSON-schema"
      url: "http://json-schema.org"
      quotes:
        - |
          "describes your existing data format; clear, human and machine readable documentation;
          complete structural validation, useful for automated testing;
          validating client-submitted data"

    - title: "How Zapier Went From Zero to 600,000+ Users in Just Three Years"
      url: https://www.groovehq.com/blog/zapier-interview-with-wade-foster
      quotes:
        - |
          "You can build a business that sells the highest quality product. 
          Companies like Apple that build things that are best in class and have the price tag to match. 
          You can build a business that offers the cheapest deals like Walmart or Amazon. 
          The thing about the best and cheapest is that it’s hard to be either one of those for a new company. 
          You’re probably not going to be the best, because your product is brand new. 
          And being cheap is really hard because you can’t take advantage of economies of scale.
          The third type of business you can build too is the one with the best customer service."

    - title: A Company Copes With Backlash Against the Raise That Roared
      url: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/business/a-company-copes-with-backlash-against-the-raise-that-roared.html
      quotes:
        - |
          "Two of Mr. Price’s most valued employees quit, spurred in part by their view that it was unfair to 
          double the pay of some new hires while the longest-serving staff members got small or no raises. 
          Some friends and associates in Seattle’s close-knit entrepreneurial network were also piqued that 
          Mr. Price’s action made them look stingy in front of their own employees."

    - title: Why Americans workers are becoming less productive
      url: http://theweek.com/articles/568713/why-americans-workers-are-becoming-less-productive
      quotes:
        - |
          "Productivity is economic output per hour worked, and it's one of the best ways 
          to measure the prosperity of a country. High productivity means more potential 
          for both wealth and leisure, since one can produce the same amount with less work."
  2015-07-27:
    - title: The Push Against Performance Reviews
      url: http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-push-against-performance-reviews
      quotes:
        - |
          "The Post's headline about the research described it succinctly: 
          'Study finds that basically every single person hates performance reviews.'"

    - title: "Superheroes a 'cultural catastrophe', says comics guru Alan Moore"
      url: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/21/superheroes-cultural-catastrophe-alan-moore-comics-watchmen
      quotes:
        - |
          "To my mind, this embracing of what were unambiguously children's characters at their mid-20th century 
          inception seems to indicate a retreat from the admittedly overwhelming complexities of modern existence," 
          he wrote to Ó Méalóid. "It looks to me very much like a significant section of the public, having given 
          up on attempting to understand the reality they are actually living in, have instead reasoned that 
          they might at least be able to comprehend the sprawling, meaningless, but at-least-still-finite 
          'universes' presented by DC or Marvel Comics.
    - title: "Is Advertising Morally Justifiable?"
      url: http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/07/14/4273200.htm
      quotes:
        - | 
            "Advertising is a natural resource extraction industry, like a fishery. Its business is the harvest 
            and sale of human attention. We are the fish and we are not consulted. First, advertising imposes 
            costs on individuals without permission or compensation. It extracts our precious attention and 
            emits toxic by-products, such as the sale of our personal information to dodgy third parties."

        - | 
            "Second, you may have noticed that the world's fisheries are not in great shape. They are a standard 
            example for explaining the theoretical concept of a tragedy of the commons, where rational 
            maximising behaviour by individual harvesters leads to the unsustainable overexploitation of a resource. 
            Expensively trained human attention is the fuel of twenty-first century capitalism. We are allowing 
            a single industry to slash and burn vast amounts of this productive resource in search of a quick buck."

    - title: The man who saw time stand still

    - title: Greek debt crisis
      url: http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5965.html
      quotes:
        - |
          They knew the Greek state was sketchy. But precisely because it was sketchy,
          prior to the financial crisis its debt paid slightly higher interest rates
          than that of safer Eurozone sovereigns. European banking regulations attached
          zero risk weights to all EU sovereigns, rendering it nearly costless for banks
          to simply manufacture deposits to purchase sovereign debt.

      url: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/i-dont-believe-in-god-but-i-believe-in-lithium.html
      quotes:
        - |
          "Elements on the periodic table can’t be patented. Pharmaceutical companies therefore have little
          incentive to promote lithium or develop other uses for it, despite its potential. It has shown
          promise as a therapy for Alzheimer’s, for example. A study in Japan has shown a sample
          population to be less likely to commit suicide after drinking tap water containing lithium."

          Inspired to make a meaningful donation, I wondered: What is the best charitable cause in the world,
          and was it crazy to think I could find it?

          I also love writing documentation. Being able to rewire the neurons
          in someone’s brain so that they understand something they didn’t
          understand before is extremely satisfying.

        - |
          It's hard to predict what life will be like in a hundred years...
          We know that everyone will drive flying cars, that zoning laws will be
          relaxed to allow buildings hundreds of stories tall, that it
          will be dark most of the time, and that women will all be trained
          in the martial arts... What kind of programming language will
          they use to write the software controlling those flying cars?

        - |
          The first programmer with/without a shadow walks in. He's quite annoyed,
          because he was neck deep in jira or git or debugging some hairy stack-trace
          on eclipse, and he's been unceremoniously yanked off to interview YOU -
          the new dude, who has no fucking idea how things really work here. Well,
          he must show YOU your place. You lowly worm, how dare you interrupt the
          lovely horizontal scroll-through of nested exceptions emerging through the
          anonymous class OOM-ing inside Spring's MetaFactoryAbstractContainer ? You shall pay.
          Dearly. Tell me, noob, how the f*** do you invert a binary tree ?

      - title: On Managing Developers
        url: http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/06/on-managing-developers/
        quotes:
          - |
            The great irony of management is that the higher up you go,
            the less actual control you have. When you are but a humble coder,
            you make the computer do exactly what you want; when you’re a manager,
            you only hope that people understand what you want,
            and then trust/pray that they do it both correctly and in a timely manner.

        quotes:
          - |
            Then there are the saints: those who, seemingly with ease, forget the wrongs
            done them and go on to lead lives free of recrimination. They, it seems,
            are of another species, but still live among us.

        quotes:
          - Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap, quick and easy to use,
            and it has swept through labs around the world as a result. Researchers
            hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases,
            create hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.

            ...a newfound willingness among some scientists to explicitly set aside
            the need for experimental confirmation of today’s most ambitious cosmic
            theories — so long as those theories are “sufficiently elegant and explanatory.”

        quotes:
          - |
            The desire for better Web APIs is what motivated the creation of JSON-LD,
            not the Semantic Web. If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality,
            stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful,
            like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in
            a way that’s useful to them.
