    - title: Greek debt crisis

      quotes:
        - |
          They knew the Greek state was sketchy. But precisely because it was sketchy, 
          prior to the financial crisis its debt paid slightly higher interest rates 
          than that of safer Eurozone sovereigns. European banking regulations attached 
          zero risk weights to all EU sovereigns, rendering it nearly costless for banks 
          to simply manufacture deposits to purchase sovereign debt.

      url: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/i-dont-believe-in-god-but-i-believe-in-lithium.html
      quotes:

          "Elements on the periodic table can’t be patented. Pharmaceutical companies therefore have little 
          incentive to promote lithium or develop other uses for it, despite its potential. It has shown 
          promise as a therapy for Alzheimer’s, for example. A study in Japan has shown a sample 
          population to be less likely to commit suicide after drinking tap water containing lithium."

          Inspired to make a meaningful donation, I wondered: What is the best charitable cause in the world, 
          and was it crazy to think I could find it?

      quotes:
        - |
          I also love writing documentation. Being able to rewire the neurons 
          in someone’s brain so that they understand something they didn’t 
          understand before is extremely satisfying.

      quotes:
        - |
          It's hard to predict what life will be like in a hundred years... 
          We know that everyone will drive flying cars, that zoning laws will be 
          relaxed to allow buildings hundreds of stories tall, that it 
          will be dark most of the time, and that women will all be trained 
          in the martial arts... What kind of programming language will 
          they use to write the software controlling those flying cars?

      quotes:
        - | 
          The first programmer with/without a shadow walks in. He's quite annoyed, 
          because he was neck deep in jira or git or debugging some hairy stack-trace 
          on eclipse, and he's been unceremoniously yanked off to interview YOU - 
          the new dude, who has no fucking idea how things really work here. Well, 
          he must show YOU your place. You lowly worm, how dare you interrupt the 
          lovely horizontal scroll-through of nested exceptions emerging through the 
          anonymous class OOM-ing inside Spring's MetaFactoryAbstractContainer ? You shall pay. 
          Dearly. Tell me, noob, how the f*** do you invert a binary tree ?

            The W3C HTML Work­ing Group char­ter is ex­pir­ing...

      - title: On Managing Developers
        url: http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/06/on-managing-developers/
        quotes:
          - |
            The great irony of management is that the higher up you go, 
            the less actual control you have. When you are but a humble coder, 
            you make the computer do exactly what you want; when you’re a manager, 
            you only hope that people understand what you want, 
            and then trust/pray that they do it both correctly and in a timely manner.

      - title: Do memory lapses help us to be happy?
        url: http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/do-memory-lapses-help-us-to-be-happy/
        quotes: 
          - | 
            Then there are the saints: those who, seemingly with ease, forget the wrongs 
            done them and go on to lead lives free of recrimination. They, it seems, 
            are of another species, but still live among us.

      - title: CRISPR, the disruptor
        url: http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673
        quotes: 
          - Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap, quick and easy to use, 
            and it has swept through labs around the world as a result. Researchers 
            hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases, 
            create hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.

      - title: A Crisis at the Edge of Physics
        url: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/a-crisis-at-the-edge-of-physics.html
        quotes:
          - |
            ...a newfound willingness among some scientists to explicitly set aside 
            the need for experimental confirmation of today’s most ambitious cosmic 
            theories — so long as those theories are “sufficiently elegant and explanatory.”
            ...“breaking with centuries of philosophical tradition of defining scientific 
            knowledge as empirical.”

      - title: JSON-LD and Why I Hate the Semantic Web (2014) 
        url: http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/
        quotes:
          - |
            The desire for better Web APIs is what motivated the creation of JSON-LD, 
            not the Semantic Web. If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, 
            stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, 
            like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in 
            a way that’s useful to them.
