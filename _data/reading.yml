        - title: On Managing Developers

          quotes:
            - |
              The great irony of management is that the higher up you go, 
              the less actual control you have. When you are but a humble coder, 
              you make the computer do exactly what you want; when you’re a manager, 
              you only hope that people understand what you want, 
              and then trust/pray that they do it both correctly and in a timely manner.

        - title: Do memory lapses help us to be happy?

          quotes: 
            - | 
              Then there are the saints: those who, seemingly with ease, forget the wrongs 
              done them and go on to lead lives free of recrimination. They, it seems, 
              are of another species, but still live among us.

        - title: CRISPR, the disruptor
          url: http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673
          quotes: 
            - Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap, quick and easy to use, 
              and it has swept through labs around the world as a result. Researchers 
              hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases, 
              create hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.

        - title: A Crisis at the Edge of Physics
          url: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/a-crisis-at-the-edge-of-physics.html
          quotes:
            - |
              ...a newfound willingness among some scientists to explicitly set aside 
              the need for experimental confirmation of today’s most ambitious cosmic 
              theories — so long as those theories are “sufficiently elegant and explanatory.”
              ...“breaking with centuries of philosophical tradition of defining scientific 
              knowledge as empirical.”

        - title: JSON-LD and Why I Hate the Semantic Web (2014) 
          url: http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/
          quotes:
            - |
              The desire for better Web APIs is what motivated the creation of JSON-LD, 
              not the Semantic Web. If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, 
              stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, 
              like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in 
              a way that’s useful to them.
