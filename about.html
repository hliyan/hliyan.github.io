title: About me
---

Hello, I'm a technology professional based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Over the past twelve years I've worked on a wide variety of things, from designing and developing high frequency trading (HFT) systems for financial markets in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong, to nation-wide electronic regulatory compliance systems for the Philippines and the International Labour Organization. I've worked with C++ most of my career (ten years), effectively making it my mother tongue, but I've worked with Perl, Python, Java, PHP and Javascript (which is my new favorite language, thanks to HTML5, ECMA6 and Node.js).

I'm currently serving as Chief Software Architect for Infoshare Ltd., a company working for positive social change through technology, and as a Technology Consultant for thinkCube Systems Ltd., a digital services company specializing in cloud applications. Before this, I was a Software Architect at MillenniumIT, a member of the London Stock Exchange Group that builds financial trading software. I graduated from the University of Moratuwa with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2003.

I'm a bit of an optimization and productivity nut: I like to automate everything that can be automated; chaos and wastage in process makes me itch intolerably; and I'm obsessed with eliminating boilerplate code, amongst other things.

In my spare time, I engage in science and technology education activities for young professionals and students, something I enjoy doing, me being a lifelong science buff and all. Even though I fancy myself an amateur science fiction writer, my novel is currently stuck in that horrible place between second draft and submission to publisher.
