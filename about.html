title: About me
---

Hello, I'm a technology professional based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Over the past twelve years I've worked on a wide variety of things, from designing and developing high frequency trading (HFT) systems for financial markets in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong, to nation-wide electronic regulatory compliance systems for the Philippines and the International Labour Organization. I've worked with C++ most of my career (ten years), effectively making it my mother tongue, but I've worked with Perl, Python, Java, PHP and Javascript (which is my new favorite language, thanks to HTML5, ECMA6 and Node.js).

I'm currently serving as Chief Software Architect for Infoshare Ltd., a company working for positive social change through technology, and as a Technology Consultant for thinkCube Systems Ltd., a digital services company specializing in cloud applications.
