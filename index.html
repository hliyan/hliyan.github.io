Hello, I'm a technology professional from Colombo, Sri Lanka. Over the past fifteen years I've worked on a wide variety of things, from designing and developing high frequency trading (HFT) systems for financial markets in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong, to electronic regulatory compliance systems for the Philippines and the International Labour Organization, to large scale e-commerce systems for a Fortune 100 corporation. I've worked with C++ most of my career (ten years), effectively making it my mother tongue, but I've worked with Perl, Python, Java, PHP and Javascript (which is my new favorite language, thanks to HTML5, ECMA6 and Node.js).

I'm currently serving as Vice President of Engineering (in reality a glorified Software Architect) for Sysco LABS, a part of [Sysco](sysco.com) focused on engineering innovation and customer facing product development.

Before this, I served as Chief Software Architect for Infoshare Ltd., a company working for positive social change through technology, and as a Technology Consultant for thinkCube Systems Ltd., a digital services company specializing in cloud applications. Before that, I was a Software Architect at MillenniumIT, a member of the London Stock Exchange Group that builds financial trading software. I graduated from the University of Moratuwa with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2003.

I'm a bit of an optimization and productivity nut: I like to automate everything that can be automated; chaos and wastage in process makes me itch intolerably; and I'm obsessed with eliminating boilerplate code, amongst other things.

In my spare time, I engage in science and technology education activities for young professionals and students, something I enjoy doing, me being a lifelong science buff and all. Even though I fancy myself an amateur science fiction writer, my novel is currently stuck in that horrible place between first publisher rejection and second draft.
