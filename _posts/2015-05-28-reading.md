## [What's fair?: New theory on income inequality](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/cuso-wfn052715.php)

Excerpts:

> Columbia Engineering Professor Venkat Venkatasubramanian has led a study that examines income inequality through a new approach: he proposes that the fairest inequality of income is a lognormal distribution.

> "This unified framework of game theory and statistical mechanics, which I call statistical teleodynamics, offers us new insights about both disciplines and answers some long-standing open questions in economics and game theory,"

As you can see, Scandinavian countries have been getting better while the US and the UK have been getting worse.

## [I Fooled Millions Into Thinking Chocolate Helps Weight Loss](http://io9.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800)

Excerpts:

> They wanted me to help demonstrate just how easy it is to turn bad science into the big headlines behind diet fads. And Onneken wanted to do it gonzo style: Reveal the corruption of the diet research-media complex by taking part.

Dropping the ball on experimental procedure:

> If you measure a large number of things about a small number of people, you are almost guaranteed to get a “statistically significant” result. Our study included 18 different measurements—weight, cholesterol, sodium, blood protein levels, sleep quality, well-being, etc.—from 15 people. (One subject was dropped.) That study design is a recipe for false positives.

Dropping the ball on peer review:

> Although the [journal] editor claims that “all articles submitted to the journal are reviewed in a rigorous way,” our paper was published less than 2 weeks after Onneken’s credit card was charged. Not a single word was changed.

Dropping the ball on journalism:

> Almost no [reporter] asked how many subjects we tested, and no one reported that number. Not a single reporter seems to have contacted an outside researcher. None are quoted.
