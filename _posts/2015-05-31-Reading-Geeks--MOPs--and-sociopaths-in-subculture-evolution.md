[Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution](http://meaningness.com/metablog/geeks-mops-sociopaths), David Chapman, 2015: discusses how once successful and thriving subcultures die at the hands of what he calls "MOPs" (members of public) and "sociopaths".

> Before there is a subculture, there is a *scene*. A scene is a small group of *creators* who invent an exciting New Thing—a musical genre, a religious sect, a film animation technique, a political theory. Riffing off each other, they produce examples and variants, and share them for mutual enjoyment, generating positive energy.

> The new scene draws *fanatics*. Fanatics don’t create, but they contribute energy (time, money, adulation, organization, analysis) to support the creators.

> If the scene is unusually exciting, and the New Thing can be appreciated without having to get utterly geeky about details, it draws *mops*.
